Of course! Expanding on text AI is a great idea, as it's the most common entry point for students. Adding an extra week gives us the flexibility to do it properly.

Here is the updated `ToC.md` file, now structured for a 26-week course with a full week dedicated to text AI.

# Introduction to AI: A Practical Guide for High School Students

Welcome to our "Introduction to AI" course materials! This curriculum is designed specifically for high school students and focuses on making Artificial Intelligence accessible, engaging, and fun.

> **Our Approach:** We believe the best way to learn AI is by *doing*. This course is built around a "prompt-first" philosophy, starting with the simple idea of communicating with AI and gradually exploring its incredible capabilities. **You won't find complex mathematics here**â€”instead, you'll discover hands-on activities, creative projects, and real-world applications.

## Course Philosophy

*   **Prompt-First Learning:** We start by teaching students how to "talk" to AI. Understanding prompts is the key to unlocking any AI tool.
*   **No Math Required:** All concepts are explained through visuals, analogies, and practical examples. No prior programming or advanced math skills are needed.
*   **Hands-On Exploration:** Students spend most of their time actively using AI tools, creating projects, and solving problems.
*   **Focus on Application, Not Just Theory:** While we cover the fundamentals, the emphasis is on how AI is used in the real world and how students can use it today.
