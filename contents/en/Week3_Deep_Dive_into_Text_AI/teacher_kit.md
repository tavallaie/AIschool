## **Quiz (Start of Class)**

### **Option 1: Written Quiz (5 minutes)**  
**Instructions:** Hand out the quiz as students enter. Give 5 minutes to complete. Collect or review answers together.

**Quiz Questions:**  
1. What is a chatbot?  
2. Name one way AI can help you with schoolwork.  
3. True or False: AI always gives perfect, fact-checked answers on its own.  
4. What does it mean to “summarize” something using AI?  
5. (Preview) What’s one fun topic you’d like to debate with an AI?

**Answer Key:**  
1. A computer program that can have conversations like a human (e.g., Siri, customer service bots).  
2. Examples: writing help, brainstorming ideas, summarizing articles, explaining hard topics.  
3. False—AI can make mistakes and needs good prompts to work well.  
4. To shorten a long text into the main points using fewer words.  
5. (Open-ended—no wrong answer!)

---

### **Option 2: Oral Quiz (5 minutes)**  
**Instructions:** Ask questions aloud. Call on volunteers or use “think-pair-share.” Praise all attempts!

**Questions:**  
1. “Who’s interacted with a chatbot before? Where?”  
2. “If you could ask an AI to help with one school assignment, what would it be?”  
3. “What’s one thing you think AI is *not* good at?”  
4. “What does ‘brainstorming’ mean—and how could AI help?”  
5. “What’s a silly topic you’d love to see an AI argue about?” (e.g., “Are pineapples okay on pizza?”)

---

### **Next-Class Quiz Questions (for Week 4)**  
Use these to review Week 3 content at the start of next week:  
1. Name two ways text AI can help with writing.  
2. What’s one limitation of chatbots?  
3. Why is it important to give AI clear instructions (prompts)?  
4. What does it mean to use AI for “brainstorming”?  
5. True or False: AI understands emotions like humans do.

**Answer Key:**  
1. Writing essays, stories, emails; editing; generating ideas.  
2. They can be wrong, biased, or repetitive; they don’t “understand” like humans.  
3. Clear prompts = better, more useful responses.  
4. Asking AI to generate many ideas quickly on a topic.  
5. False—AI mimics emotion but doesn’t feel it.

## **Detailed Teacher’s Script**

### **1. Quiz (5 min)**  
> “Alright team, let’s kick things off with a quick 5-minute quiz! Don’t worry—it’s not about being perfect. It’s about getting your brain warmed up for today’s topic: **Text AI**—the kind of AI that reads, writes, and chats like a super-smart study buddy. Grab your handout or just listen if we’re doing oral. Ready?”

*(Administer chosen quiz format. Keep it light and encouraging.)*

---

### **2. Hook & Introduction (7 min)**  
> “Imagine you’re playing your favorite RPG—like Fortnite or Zelda—and you meet an NPC (non-player character) who doesn’t just say the same line over and over… but actually *responds* to what you say, helps you solve puzzles, or even debates whether dragons are cooler than robots. That’s **text AI** in action!  
>  
> Today, we’re going beyond buttons and menus. We’re diving into AI that *talks back*—chatbots, writing helpers, idea generators. You’ve probably used one without even realizing it: when Siri answers your question, or when your phone suggests a reply to a text.  
>  
> By the end of class, you’ll have *debated* an AI, used it to brainstorm, and maybe even tricked it into writing a poem about your pet goldfish!”

*(Pause for laughter or reactions.)*

> “But here’s the big myth we’re busting today: **‘AI knows everything and never makes mistakes.’** Nope! AI is like a very fast, very eager student who hasn’t actually *lived* anything. It repeats patterns from the internet—so it can be brilliant… or totally wrong. That’s why *you*—the human—are the boss. Your prompts guide it. Your brain checks its work.”

---

### **3. Core Lesson (20 min)**  

**Slide 1: What’s a Chatbot?**  
> “First up: **chatbots**. These are AI programs designed to have conversations. Think: customer service bots, mental health chatbots, or even AI friends in apps. They don’t ‘think’—they predict the next word based on millions of examples. Cool, right? But they can get confused if your question is vague.”

**Student Participation #1:**  
> “Turn to a partner: Name one place you’ve seen a chatbot. Was it helpful? Frustrating? Funny?”  
*(Give 60 seconds. Call on 2–3 pairs to share.)*

**Slide 2: AI as Your Writing Assistant**  
> “Next: AI can be your **writing wingman**. Stuck on an essay intro? Ask AI: *‘Write a strong opening paragraph about climate change for a 9th-grade audience.’* Need a story idea? Try: *‘Give me three plot twists for a mystery about a missing lunchbox.’*  
>  
> But remember: AI writes *with* you—not *for* you. You still need to edit, add your voice, and check facts.”

**Slide 3: Summarize, Explain, Brainstorm**  
> “AI shines at three superpowers:  
> - **Summarize**: Turn a 500-word article into 3 sentences.  
> - **Explain**: ‘Explain photosynthesis like I’m 12.’  
> - **Brainstorm**: ‘Give me 10 names for a YouTube channel about skateboarding cats.’  
>  
> These are *tools*—like a calculator for words.”

**Student Participation #2:**  
> “Shout out one topic you wish you could get a quick summary of right now!”  
*(Write 2–3 on board: e.g., “Black holes,” “how TikTok works,” “the French Revolution.”)*  
> “Later, you’ll get to try this yourself!”

### **4. Activity: “AI Debate Showdown” (20 min)**  

> “Now, it’s your turn! We’re playing **AI Debate Showdown**. Your mission: pick a fun, silly debate topic and ask an AI to argue one side. Then see how convincing it is!”

**Instructions:**  
- Go to [LLM URL].  
- Type: *“Debate me: [your topic]. You argue that [position].”*  
  Example: *“Debate me: Pineapple belongs on pizza. You argue that it does.”*  
- Read the AI’s response. Is it logical? Funny? Weird?

**Group Adaptation:**  
If devices are limited, assign topics to small groups. One student types, others brainstorm prompts. Compare AI responses across groups.

**Teacher Facilitation:**  
- Circulate, help with logins or phrasing.  
- Encourage creativity: “Try arguing that homework should be banned!”  
- Remind: “Don’t just copy—think about *how* the AI builds its case.”

**Debrief Questions (after activity):**  
1. “What surprised you about your AI’s argument?”  
2. “Did it use facts, emotions, or just sound confident?”  
3. “Would you trust this AI to help with a real school debate?”

### **5. Wrap-up & Assignment (13 min)**  

> “Awesome work today! Let’s recap:  
> - Chatbots = conversational AI (but not human!).  
> - Text AI can write, summarize, explain, and brainstorm—*if you guide it well*.  
> - And no, it doesn’t ‘know’ truth—it predicts based on patterns.”

**Address Misconception Again:**  
> “Remember: AI isn’t magic. It’s a mirror of the internet—flaws and all. **You** are the thinker. AI is just a tool.”

**Introduce Assignment:**  
> “For homework, you’ll use your handout to complete a mini-project: **Ask an AI to summarize a short article or video transcript** (I’ll give you a link or you can pick your own). Then answer: How helpful was it? What did it miss? Bring your handout next class!”

**Preview Next Week:**  
> “Next time, we level up: **Image & Voice AI**! Ever wanted to turn a text description into a dragon riding a skateboard? Get ready!”

## **Activity Guide**

**Name:** AI Debate Showdown  
**Time:** 20 minutes  
**Goal:** Practice using text AI for creative, persuasive tasks while understanding its limitations.

**Individual Focus:**  
Each student selects a lighthearted debate topic and crafts a prompt to generate an AI argument.

**Group Adaptation:**  
- In groups of 3–4, students brainstorm 2–3 fun topics together.  
- Each group picks one topic and assigns roles: Prompt Writer, AI Reader, Fact Checker, Presenter.  
- Groups compare AI responses and vote: “Which AI made the funniest/most convincing case?”

**Instructions for the Teacher:**  
1. Ensure all students can access the LLM.  
2. Display example prompt on screen: *“Debate me: Video games are good for your brain. Argue YES.”*  
3. Give students 10–12 minutes to interact with AI.  
4. Use last 5–8 minutes for sharing: invite 3–4 volunteers to read their AI’s argument aloud.  
5. Ask debrief questions (see script).

**Student Instructions:**  
> “Pick a fun debate topic (e.g., ‘School should start at 10 a.m.’ or ‘Aliens probably exist’).  
> Ask the AI to argue **one side** using a clear prompt.  
> Read its response. Is it logical? Silly? Surprising? Be ready to share!”

**Outcome:**  
Students gain firsthand experience with AI’s persuasive style and limitations. Sharing builds critical thinking and humor.

**Debrief Questions:**  
1. What made your AI’s argument strong or weak?  
2. Did it use facts, opinions, or just sound confident?  
3. Could you tell it didn’t *really* believe what it was saying?
